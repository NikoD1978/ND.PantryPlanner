## Description
ND.PantryPlanner is a training exercise for me, to hone my skills at .NET MAUI development without the comfort of my employers' easy-to-use frameworks, toolkits and dialog designers.

The application allows users to track the items in their pantry.

## Getting Started
To get started with ND.PantryPlanner, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Open the solution file `ND.PantryPlanner.sln` in Visual Studio.
3. Restore the NuGet packages by right-clicking on the solution and selecting "Restore NuGet Packages".
4. Build the solution to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
5. Deploy the application to your preferred device or emulator by selecting the target device and clicking the "Run" button in Visual Studio.

## Usage
This project can be used as a template for building your own pantry management application. You can customize the features, design, and functionality to suit your needs.
